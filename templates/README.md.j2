# Knowledge Base of Jaremy Hatler

This is my personal knowledge base, and will be a perpetual work in progress.
This file is generated from the `data.yml` file using the `templates/README.md.j2`
template. The images are stored in the `imgs` directory, and the source links are
included when available. I don't claim any of this as my own work unless explicitly
stated.

**Planned Enhancements:**

- [ ] Create standardized information for each entry:
    - [X] Title
    - [X] Image
    - [X] Source
    - [ ] Keywords
    - [ ] Summary (Purpose and key concepts)
    - [ ] Target Audience
    - [ ] Indications & Contraindications
    - [ ] Pros & Cons
    - [ ] Related Concepts
    - [ ] Related Entries
- [ ] Create project to track:
  - [ ] Outstanding entries I want to add from my notes and other sources.
  - [ ] Compliance with the above standardization.
- [ ] GitHub.io site.
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow to update the README.md and routinely check for
  broken links (automatically create issues).
- [ ] Separate sections into different files.
- [ ] Add a table of contents.


{%- for category in data.categories %}

![{{ entry.title }}](imgs/{{ entry.image }})

{% if entry.source %}Source: [{{ entry.source }}]({{ entry.source }}){% endif %}

</details>
